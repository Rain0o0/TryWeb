个人测试用前端网页文件
Hello!This is one of my web project, which may be used to save code or display it to others.
It No matter how you find this file,if you like,you can use it, but just don't mock me.
I only wrote a few simple features for it, but for mainstream web pages, these features are completely sufficient.
The technology stack used: Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, and so on.
I used Ngrok's intranet penetration function for deployment during development, so if you want to use it, you may need to modify the relevant code.
This part is be used to link git and github.
I will fix some files here but I cannot guarantee that they will be used correctly, so please do not download this branch.
